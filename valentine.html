            <h3>Dear Hex,</h3>
            <h3>Happy Valentines day! I wanna say thank you so much for your kindness and for the small things that makes life
                enjoyable. I don't want to think too much about the future but I always ask God for His wisdom in regards to uncertainty.
                Looking back, I always remember that time that I offered you my sushi from my snack box on the stair case. Fun times! 
                Things change a lot since I left the Philippines to go to the US. Yes! We both change so does our surroundings too. Some of
                our friendships fade, but other friendships became new and grow on us. (Note: I called you Hex because I don't want to reveal
                too much about you on my portfolio haha). Well, I made this website for you because you are very special. I just made this in a day 
                just for a fun fact! And yes, I wrote this whole shabang back in January 8,2026. Hay nako, ganun talaga ang buhay noh? I don't want
                to make this in a long essay (essay sucks) so in summary, I am looking forward with our goals and dreams. It's funny that we both love
                computers lol. I'll drop a memory verse underneath this letter. It's nice talking with you.
            </h3>
